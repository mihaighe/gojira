        Joe and Mario Duplantier, two brothers aged nineteen and fourteen
        respectively, decided to start a band based on a technical melodic death
        metal, and recruited nineteen years old Christian Andreu."A passionate
        guitarist, like us, of Metallica", said Mario Duplantier. They began
        practicing together their guitars riffs and drum parts in the Duplantier
        family garage where the group had quickly set up a studio, in their
        hometown of Ondres, in the south of the Landes department, at the gates
        of Bayonne. Soon after, they enlisted bassist Alexandre Cornillon, a
        friend of Andreu. Joe Duplantier remembered that "We wanted to go fast
        and strong. We had no plan, no pressure. ... We didn't even have a
        name". By then, the Duplantier brothers were each playing in their own
        metal bands that they had started two years previously. Both were
        already regarded for their abilities.

        In 1996, they formed Godzilla. When making a decision on a choice for a
        band name, the idea came from the original version of the fictional
        monster Godzilla, filmed in black and white, as they appreciated from
        the beginning "the myth of the big pissed off atomic lizard. ... It was
        in our heads a symbol of devastating power". The band's first
        performance was effectuated four months after the formation, playing in
        the bars of Bayonne. They would sell cassettes at shows and to their
        friends. Delivering a straight-ahead death metal with elements of trash
        metal, Godzilla self-released a pair of demo albums, Victim in 1996, and
        Possessed in 1997, and began touring in the south west of France.
        Cornillon left the band in nuary 1998, and was replaced by Jean-Michel
        Labadie, a "young bass player very active on the Basque scene".
