        Joe and Mario Duplantier, two brothers aged nineteen and fourteen
        respectively, decided to start a band based on a technical melodic death
        metal, and recruited nineteen years old Christian Andreu."A passionate
        guitarist, like us, of Metallica", said Mario Duplantier. They began
        practicing together their guitars riffs and drum parts in the Duplantier
        family garage where the group had quickly set up a studio, in their
        hometown of Ondres, in the south of the Landes department, at the gates
        of Bayonne. Soon after, they enlisted bassist Alexandre Cornillon, a
        friend of Andreu. Joe Duplantier remembered that "We wanted to go fast
        and strong. We had no plan, no pressure. ... We didn't even have a
        name". By then, the Duplantier brothers were each playing in their own
        metal bands that they had started two years previously. Both were
        already regarded for their abilities.

        In 1996, they formed Godzilla. When making a decision on a choice for a
        band name, the idea came from the original version of the fictional
        monster Godzilla, filmed in black and white, as they appreciated from
        the beginning "the myth of the big pissed off atomic lizard. ... It was
        in our heads a symbol of devastating power". The band's first
        performance was effectuated four months after the formation, playing in
        the bars of Bayonne. They would sell cassettes at shows and to their
        friends. Delivering a straight-ahead death metal with elements of trash
        metal, Godzilla self-released a pair of demo albums, Victim in 1996, and
        Possessed in 1997, and began touring in the south west of France.
        Cornillon left the band in nuary 1998, and was replaced by Jean-Michel
        Labadie, a "young bass player very active on the Basque scene".

        The band continued their progress and recorded two more homemade demo
        albums, Saturate released in the fall of 1999, and Wisdom Comes in 2000.
        After touring, supporting Cannibal Corpse, Edge of Sanity, Impaled
        Nazarene, and Immortal in September 1999, legal problems forced Godzilla
        to change their name. The band changed its name to "Gojira", the rōmaji
        spelling of Godzilla. During the tour with Immortal their exposure
        spread all over the country, and they began to acquire a reputation on
        the French underground metal scene for their "incendiary riffs". But at
        the same time, they immersed themselves in the songwriting of a first
        album, already planned since 1996. Joe Duplantier said that he was
        inspired by Mike Oldfield, when writing the songs.

        Enticed by the album's production quality of a metal band from Paris,
        Gojira moved on the spur of the moment, in the same studio in Brussels
        to record their debut album, Terra Incognita. Before entering the
        recording studio, they solicited friends and family members to support
        the budget through donations. Although Joe Duplantier admitted that
        Gojira was taking a long time to compose, the recording process lasted
        ten days. At this point, after completing the recording and mixing by
        Stephan Kraemer at Impuls Studios, Gojira had neither label, nor record
        company, nor management. Moreover, the labels deemed them "too
        ambitious" for their style of music—quoted as "a real war machine"—and
        told them to stop death metal and sing in French. Joe Duplantier said:
        "The door was clearly closed". The band understood then that the best
        way to get out of the deadlock was to get structured. Gojira formed
        their own label named Gabriel Editions, via a limited liability company,
        becoming autonomous and consequently able "to produce their music from A
        to Z". To "manage the band's activities, financing everything
        ourselves", said Andreu.
